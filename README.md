# WeatherApp
Simple weather app to start using Kotlin. Following the book 'Kotlin for Android developers'.

I finally decided to start looking into Kotlin and to do that I bought the book 'Kotlin for Android developer'.
This repository contains the example app the book uses and I'll add changes as I see fit.
